# finalproject

To connect through the cluster: jupyter notebook --ip 10.90.38.18

## Architecture of the repo:
### `finalproject_cluster.ipynb`: This is the main notebook. 
Run each cell on the right order and everything should be fine.
### `timetable_preprocessing_marian.ipynb`: 
Secondary notebook used to preprocess data related to the 2019 timetable of cff. Was more convenient to use it off the cluster.
### `visualisation.png`
In case of non-reproduceability, you can see how folium could have worked.

## Deployment:
Just need to run it on the cluster, but you should download the dataset as well.

## Reproducibility:
Run every cells, in order. It might take half an hour.
